m0dw3rks-Icons [ m0dw3rks.com ] My personal icons primarily for uncommon mimetypes and applications.

Right now the state of the set is incomplete (several thousand need to be done yet). There are lots of included icons that are uninspired or "roughed in" for now. I design things to fit what it represents rather than adhering to a cohesive style. This also lends itself to icons being easier to identify since not everything is a square or circle with something inside. Color and shape allow icons to stand out from each other. Hydraulic systems for compressed file formats, colored speakers for audio formats, "mix tapes" for playlist formats, tons of color variance for things like color coded ssh sessions, loose leaf and a pencil for text files, edge perf dot matrix print outs for log files and Satanic rituals for printers...am I right?!

1085 icons total from 16x16 to 512x512. Fair warning my focus is for dark themes. While I typically focus on things I use, there are already a lot of things I don't use included in the set <strike>and I add to and update the collection frequently</strike>. I've removed the scalable simply because files that have text have not been converted to paths (for now) and some render wrong in general.

# Installation
Unzip / Decompress or clone the git to either ~/.local/share/icons or /usr/share/icons for system wide use.

Copy, move or symlink the xml files in the xml folder to /usr/share/mime/packages/ and update your mime database.

(sudo|doas) (cp|mv|ln -s) *.xml /usr/share/mime/packages/
