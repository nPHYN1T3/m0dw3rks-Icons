My personal icons primarily for mimetypes
You may want to alter the index.theme file and set the Inherits value to your prefered fallback icon set.

Right now the state of the set is incomplete. There are lots of included icons that are just uninspired and "roughed in" for now. My set is not something I'd call theme cohesive. I make things I feel fits what I want, not something that fits a style guide.

Unzip / Decompress to either ~/.local/share/icons or /usr/share/icons for system wide use.

*Beware I've not flattend all the files with text so if you don't have a given font the scalable versions might "explode" visually.
