m0dw3rks-Icons [ m0dw3rks.com ] My personal icons primarily for mimetypes and uncommon applications.

Right now the state of the set is incomplete (possibly several thousand need to be done yet). There are lots of included icons that are uninspired or "roughed in" for now. I design things to fit what it represents rather than adhering to a cohesive style. Hydraulic systems for compressed file formats, colored speakers for audio formats, "mix tapes" for playlist formats, tons of color variance for things like color coded ssh sessions, loose leaf and a pencil for text files, edge perf dot matrix print outs for log files and Satanic rituals for printers...am I right?!

Icons from 16x16 to 512x512 and fair warning things are typically designed for dark themes. While I typically focus on things I use, there are already a lot of things I don't use included in the set and I add to and update the collection frequently. I've removed the scalable simply because files that have text have not been converted to paths (for now.) (Preview Below)

<h1>Installation</h1>
Unzip / Decompress or clone the git to either ~/.local/share/icons or /usr/share/icons for system wide use.
You may want to alter the index.theme file and set the Inherits value to your preferred fallback icon set to fill in potential gaps.
