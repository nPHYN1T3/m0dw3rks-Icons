m0dw3rks-Icons [ m0dw3rks.com ] My personal icons primarily for mimetypes and uncommon applications.


Right now the state of the set is incomplete (possibly several thousand need to be done yet). There are lots of included icons that are uninspired or "roughed in" for now. I design things to fit what it represents rather than adhering to a cohesive style. This also lends itself to icons being easier to identify since not everything is a square or circle with something inside. Color and shape allow icons to stand out from each other. Hydraulic systems for compressed file formats, colored speakers for audio formats, "mix tapes" for playlist formats, tons of color variance for things like color coded ssh sessions, loose leaf and a pencil for text files, edge perf dot matrix print outs for log files and Satanic rituals for printers...am I right?!


Icons are supposed to be a visual representation of real world analogs but much of those represented items have become antiquated. Think of how many people that have no clue what the save icon is? (5.25" Disks) Who uses actual folders in real life anymore? Sadly most UI is still white background black text? WHY? It chews battery on mobile and strains your eyes! Because the real world analog was white paper and black or blue ink...That is an analog that can kindly die in a fire...possibly a fire started by the garbage printers that still perpetuate this along with various other evils. (The older I get the more "Stallman" I get...and Richard Stallman is to Tech what Vegans are to food.)


661 icons total from 16x16 to 512x512. Fair warning my focus is for dark themes. While I typically focus on things I use, there are already a lot of things I don't use included in the set and I add to and update the collection frequently. I've removed the scalable simply because files that have text have not been converted to paths (for now.) (Small Preview Below)


# Installation
Unzip / Decompress or clone the git to either ~/.local/share/icons or /usr/share/icons for system wide use.
You may want to alter the index.theme file and set the Inherits value to your preferred fallback icon set to fill in potential gaps.


Copy, symlink or move the xml files in the xml folder to /usr/share/mime/packages/ and update your mime database.

sudo cp *.xml /usr/share/mime/packages/

sudo update-mime-database /usr/share/mime/
